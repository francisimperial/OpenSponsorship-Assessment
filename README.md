# OpenSponsorship Intern Assessment
The main purpose of this analysis was to split the given data into two different subsets of data: 
* Product Category
* Brand Category
Then from these subsets, I created visualizations using Matplotlib to showcase the number of companies in each product or brand category, as well as a group horizontal bar chart comparing the number of companies based in and out of the United States. <br>

## Steps in Data Cleansing and Creating Visualizations
You may view my Jupyter Notebook file [here](data_cleaning.ipynb).
I commented in every cell to describe each step of the process. Please let me know if you have any questions. <br>

## Analysis
Initially, it seemed as if there was not much to go off of given the amount of Null datapoints, however, I was able to find enough data to create an analysis. <br>

### Product Category

* Found that the three most popular Product Categories were in Apparel & Jewelery, Food & Beverage, and Health & Medical.
* This makes sense since Apparel, Food, and Health services are important components of the Sports Industry. <br>
